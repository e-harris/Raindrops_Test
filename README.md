#**Raindrops Test**

For this test I have been tasked with creating a function that returns a value depending on the factors passed into the function.

For this task, I have decided to use Python.

###Requirements
 - Python 3.7

###Running the tests

To use the tests, call `python test_rainbow.py` in your directory


Here is the task I was provided with:

```
Raindrops

Write a function that takes as its input a number (n) and converts it to a string, the contents of which depend on the numbers factors

- if the number has a factor of 3, output 'Pling'
- if the number has a factor of 5, output 'Plang'
- if the number has a factor of 7, output 'Plong'
- if the number does not have any of the above as a factor simply return the numbers digits

This test can be completed in a language of your choice and should be made available on your Github account in a public repository. You should write tests to cover your expected range of inputs and outputs. Commit often and document well.

You will be assessed on the quality of your code, functional correctness, and your approach to quality assurance and testing.```
